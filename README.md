A simple solution to the Frontend Mentor **Single Page Developer Portfolio** challenge.

## Built With
- Vite

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally or build it for production.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hiticas/Single-page-developer-portfolio-Vite.git
cd Single-page-developer-portfolio-Vite
```

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

After running this command, Vite will provide a local URL where you can view the project in your browser.

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a dist folder containing the optimized, production-ready files. You can deploy the contents of this folder to any static hosting service (e.g. Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).
